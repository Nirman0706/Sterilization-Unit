# Sterilization-Unit
Microprocessor 8086

Description: This unit performs sterilization by increasing temperature to
maximum value (x0C). The temperature has to be maintained at the maximum
value for 2 minutes before it is brought gradually to a nominal temperature
value (y0C). The time taken for bringing down the temperature can be varied
between four different values as decided by the user. A slider is used to decide
this value
Level 1: 2 minutes
Level 2: 4 minutes
Level 3: 6 minutes
Level 4: 8 minutes
While the sterilization process is taking place the door to the unit must remain
locked. The Door can be opened only when user presses End.
User Interface: Status LED glows as long as the sterilization process is being
done. Once 30 C has been reached then LED goes off and the door mechanism
unlocks. Once the door is closed again the temperature has to be brought back
to 30 C.
